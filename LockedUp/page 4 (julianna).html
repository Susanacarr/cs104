<p>Thank you for choosing Locked Up for your banking and saving usage.</p>

<p2>Please carefully read the Terms and Conditions of Locked Up's Banking Services before agreeing.</p2>

<h2> Usage of Site; Agreement of Terms of Use </h2>

<p3> These Terms and Conditions of Use apply to the app located on the app store, and all associated sites linked to www.Lockedup.com. By using the site, you agree to these terms of us, if not agreed, usage of the website and app will not be allowed.</p3></br><br> 


<p4> Locked up reserves the right to make users not be allowed to withdraw money (tax-free) until the goal is reached. Any early access before the set goal will result in a fee. This fee will differ based on the amount being withdrawn. The maximum number of savings accounts a user can open is 4. Each of which can have a different saving goal and time to be completed. Once an account is opened and everytime a new goal is set, users will be required to sign an agreement acknowledging locking money. When an account is first opened, there is 30 days for users to get the minimum $100 in the account. Failure to do so will result in a penalty added to your account.</p4></br></br>

<p5> WARNING, if you do the following your account will be banned either temporarily or permanently. If a user takes all the money out of their credit and does not pay it back in time, they will get a warning, and if it is still not paid off, a permanent ban will be the consequence.  A temporarily ban will be if a users account is not in use.</p5></br></br>

<p6> Users can opt in, and are encouraged to turn on notifications to receive messages from the app. These will be alerts each time the card is used and a monthly reminder for users to keep saving. </p6>
